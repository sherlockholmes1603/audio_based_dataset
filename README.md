# Project on Classification of audio based datasets

# Overview

Welcome to the Capuchin Bird Audio Classifier project! This repository showcases a classifier trained to distinguish between audio samples of Capuchin bird calls and various urban environmental sounds from the UrbanSound8K dataset. By combining these two distinct datasets, we aim to create a robust classifier capable of identifying Capuchin bird vocalizations in real-world urban soundscapes.

# Project Motivation

Capuchin birds are known for their unique and diverse vocalizations that vary across species and contexts. However, identifying these calls within the cacophony of urban environments can be challenging due to the presence of various human-made sounds. This project seeks to address this challenge by leveraging machine learning techniques to automatically recognize Capuchin bird calls amidst urban noise, thus aiding researchers and enthusiasts in studying these avian species in urban settings.
